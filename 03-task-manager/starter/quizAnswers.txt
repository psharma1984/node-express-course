1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application... 
Middleware is used to process requests before they reach route handlers. Global middleware can be used for all routes eg app.use(() => { next()}).
For a specific route use function arguments as app.get(path,middleware,other parameters)

2. What does CRUD stand for? Create, Read, Update, Delete

    (a) How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file? Install dotenv package. Call dotenv.config() and then using global process.env 
    (b) How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository? add .env to .gitignore
